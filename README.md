#An Article I Found Interesting:
[Improving Gender Inclusion by Using Agile Principles](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/10/gender-inclusion-agile/)

I thought this article was interesting because it showed how agile principles could be modified to work best for a specific project, which in this case was a coding boot camp ("CodeGirls") for girls in Pakistan. The interview with the camp's founder, Faiza Yousuf, gave me a lot of insight into how flexible the SCRUM framework could be, and how it could be applied to more than just software development projects. For example, in the process of founding CodeGirls, Yousuf and her co-founders modified the agile principles so that their clients were the stakeholders, their training camp was their "software," and their retention and conversion rates were the metrics to measure the success of their software.

Some other key takeaways I got from Yousuf's interview was that change is constant when following the agile principles— CodeGirls started off with many different test programs that were eventually discarded because of their ineffectiveness. The current state of CodeGirls is simply the remaining parts of the program that the founders thought worked really well. Additionally, the CodeGirls team still remains relatively small with only three full-time employees— it shows that a smaller team that works well together and can remain transparent in their communication is key in following agile principles. Finally, Yousuf says that in founding CodeGirls, she learned that you shouldn't always come up with an elaborate plan before starting your project— in fact, it's best to start right away and adapt to any changes you might make to your project as you go.
